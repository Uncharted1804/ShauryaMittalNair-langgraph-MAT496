# Shaurya Mittal Nair's LangGraph Course Submission

This repository contains my code tweaks and progress for the "Intro to LangGraph" course. All tweaks are stored in the `my_tweaks` folder, and this document tracks the learning and modifications for each lesson.

## Video-by-Video Learning and Tweaks

### Module 1, Lesson 1: Motivation
- **Learned:** Understood that traditional agent executors operate in a single, often brittle loop. LangGraph is motivated by the need to add more control, cycles, and stateful logic to create robust and predictable agentic systems.
- **My Tweak:** Instead of a search agent, I created a simple 'Math Agent' using the modern tool-calling agent structure. This demonstrates the basic components (tool, prompt, LLM, executor) that LangGraph will orchestrate in more complex ways.
